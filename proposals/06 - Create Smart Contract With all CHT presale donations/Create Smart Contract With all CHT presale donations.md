# Gov Prop 4: Create Presale Escrow Smart Contract 

## Details: This is a text based proposal to involve presale participants in the process of moving forward of returning donations for CHT.

### Details - Create Escrow Contract.

Chronic Network will continue to progress towards maximum decentralization by collaborating with the participants on a fair, transparent way to return presale tokens.

The Smart Contract, to be deployed on chain will include 1 governance voting power to all CHT presale donation addresses. The only two functions of the escrow contract are as follows, however note that functions are only oprational as the result of each governance vote:

- Text Based proposal: +50% quorum, +50% consensus 

- Send Tx Message[from,to]: +50% quorum, 66% consensus

Both functions in order to proceed will need 50% of the all potential addresses with voting power. Sending  escrowed tokens will need more than 2/3rds of all potential addresses approval before executing.

There is an active working group disscussing these next steps in telegram, if you are a presale donation participant and would like to be actively involved, please DM one of the community leads in Telegram.
