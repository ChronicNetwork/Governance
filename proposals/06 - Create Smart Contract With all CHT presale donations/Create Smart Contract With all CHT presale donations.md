# Gov Prop 6: Create Presale Escrow Smart Contract 

## Details: This is a text based proposal to involve presale participants in the process of moving forward of returning donations for CHT.

### Details - Create Escrow Contract.

Chronic Network will continue to progress towards maximum decentralization by collaborating with the participants on a fair, transparent way to return presale tokens.

The Smart Contract, to be deployed on chain will include 1 governance voting power to all CHT presale donation addresses. The only two functions of the escrow contract are as follows, however note that functions are only oprational as the result of each governance vote:

- Text Based proposal: +50% quorum, +50% consensus 

- Send Tx Message[from,to]: +50% quorum, +50% consensus [EDITED Wed. August 3rd].

Both functions in order to proceed will need 50% of the all potential addresses with voting power. Sending escrowed tokens will need more than 2/3rds of all potential addresses approval before executing.

There is an active working group disscussing these next steps in telegram, if you are a presale donation participant and would like to be actively involved, please DM one of the community leads in Telegram.

The DAO of participants will be insantiated by core modules that are created by the DAODAO team, which if you would like to confirm the code can find their repo [here](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts). 

A log of the code-ids stored on Chronic Chain can be found [here](https://github.com/ChronicNetwork/documentation/blob/main/smart-contracts/Code-ID%20Log.csv).These can be used to validate the codes authenticity (s/o cosmwasm smart contracts).

Specifics regarding the dao & a user interface for voting on proposals is in the works.


History: 
Chronic Chain is a project we truly believe embodies core values that align with perservering throughout hardships to provide something that truly will provide a chance to do better for others. If you are an og to CHT, then you might understand that we:
 1. Are cannabis culture
 2. Have suffered tremendous loss; both personally, & as a community
 3. Progress that includes fairness & transparency has proved to be extremely powerful for this project as a whole.

For those of you who might not be aware of the history of Chronic as a project, we can provide insight on where it started, & how we have gotten to where we are in this current point of time.

1. CHT was previously an ERC-20 token. The total supply was 420 million & there was a 3% buy & sell fee, 1% of which was distributed back to holders of CHT. Marketing & collaboration effort were ongoing and during these 2 months was really what formed the foundation for what the Chronic Chain Community has become now. 

2. On October 2021, the project suffered an damaging exploit in the supply of the Token. In return, liquidity pools reflected an artificually manipulated price of the tokens, resulting in the exploiter to drain 99.999% of the ETH tokens paired with CHT in the lp pool. 

Here is the wallet address holding the exploited funds, it has been flagged by Etherscan & proper authorities have been notified. 
- Address 1: [Exploiter](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8bc312fe6b289e95c23c6494dbf305a46f1c2761)
- Address 2: [LP Tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a9a8244fcd6861521d41825945b35057152184e)
- Address 3:[CEX-connected](https://etherscan.io/address/0x379ef9c4e86b13ea4335fabdd88512fdcb5f156b)
The exploiter attemped to hide the trace of funds that was used to pay for the gas fee's of the exploit. With some digging & cross checking each others findings, a few community members are able to be confident of the wallet address that funded the expoit, & is connected to a centralized exchange.


It was truly a kick to the gut.

3. While the dust was settling, inital development & testing for the better, more secure protocol that a [Cosmos-SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) & [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) based smart contract platform can provide was ongoing. Instead of relaunching immediately on BSC or another L2, the goal was to not make back money that was lost but to build the tooling & provide the utility for all to build from. 

4. While testing was ongoing core team lead at the time decided that a presale was needed for the new protocol's utility token CHT, as all previous holders of CHT were to be obligated 100% of the total supply in the form of CGAS(Chronic Gas), the gas token that powers transactions & messages on Chronic Chain.  People were able to participate in the presale of CHT in various forms; such as ETH, USDC, CASHAPP, PAYPAL, & DEBIT CARD. This was done in such an improper way that has caused those who are newly contributing to the network to prioiritize mitgation of this issue, in a way that is progressive, transparent, & fair. There are standards that need to exist for the saftey of those participating, as well as those contributing their time & energy.

We believe this proposal can provide direct proof to agreeing on the best way to move forward, given our circumstances, in a way way that can be viable for future communtity members, and appreciate all participants in this governance vote.
